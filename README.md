# BestBuy-Stock-Checker-Test
 This tool was created as an experiment and was used for educational purposes only. The use of the product is limited to notifying a discord webhook if a product is in stock. There is no way to purchase an item or interact with best buy in any malicious way.
 
 The use of proxies is only needed when running the program for an extended period of time or when the program is used for real time stock availability.

 You need to make a file named api.key in .\meta for the BestBuy_API.py to work (p.s. you need an api key)
